* Instructions

Use `make` to create the executable file called `0123Homework`.
Either run `./0123Homework` and manually input the previous digest and nonce, or
use input redirection (e.g. input in file called test.in) like ]
`./0123Homework < test.in`.

You may specify the grid and block size as command line arguments, i.e.
`0123Homework [grid size] [block size]`. Either both sizes have to be specified,
or none are specified and default values are used.

NOTE: I also have some extra outputs before the requested output to confirm
the grid and block size to be used for the kernel.
