The current directory should contain the following files:
1. This README
2. Makefile
3. main.cu
4. utils.h
5. hash.h
6. hash.cu


Use `make` to create the executable file called `0123Homework`.
Either run `./0123Homework` and manually input the previous digest and nonce, or
use input redirection (e.g. input in file called test.in) like ]
`./0123Homework < test.in`.


nvprof: /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvprof ./main


Data parallelism:
- (Existing) Every thread tries to find a nonce and check digest against target,
 otherwise + total number of threads to try next nonce


Task parallelism:
-
